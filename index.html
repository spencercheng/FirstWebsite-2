      <h2> What is it?</h2>
      <p>There is much debate of how this dish came to be, but most agree that its origins began in Persia as a rustic
        rice-and-meat dish and then traveled to India. The various recipes of biryani were then born, mainly where there
        was culinary influence from Muslim foods, particularly in the city of Hyderabad in south India, but also along
        the southern coast. Biryani's many, many variations depend on where the dish is based. Some differences are
        subtle while others are distinguished by added or substituted ingredients. </p>

      <h2>About this Biriyani </h2>
      <p>You’ll find variations of Biryani all across the Indian subcontinent, from Pakistan to Bangladesh, Afghanistan
        to India. There are 2 main types – one where the protein and/or vegetables are cooked mixed throughout the rice,
        and the other version known as Hyderabad-style biryani in India where meat and rice are layered and cook in a
        sealed pot over fire. The latter is the style of biryani I’m sharing today.</p>
